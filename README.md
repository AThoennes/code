# code
## Description
This is my first attempt at a shell script. It create a file with the specified 
name (as of right now it only suports java) and allows you to specify if you want
a main method in the class or not. By default, this script will write the file and 
it's contents to the Desktop.

## Installation
To use, put the *Emphasised text*code file into the directory, *Emphasised text*/usr/local/bin/ and put *Emphasised text*. /usr/local/bin/code
into *Emphasised text*~/.bash_profile
